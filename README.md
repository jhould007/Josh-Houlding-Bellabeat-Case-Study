# Josh-Houlding-Bellabeat-Case-Study
A case study I completed as part of the final course in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera. 

Check out the [full report here.](https://github.com/jhould007/Josh-Houlding-Bellabeat-Case-Study/blob/main/Bellabeat%20Case%20Study.pdf)

Bellabeat is a technology company founded by Urška Sršen and Sandro Mur that produces wearable devices targeted toward women. These devices are intended to provide women with data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, empowering them to make healthier life decisions. According to their website, a “massive majority of all products are created for and tested on men, then marketed to women.” This means they have a good chance of being sub-optimal for women who buy them. As such, Bellabeat’s mission is to provide women with devices made for them that can track menstrual cycles, as they play a huge role in a woman’s health.

The objective of this analysis was to analyze usage data from non-Bellabeat smart devices (Fitbit in this case) to understand how consumers use them, then use those insights to guide Bellabeat marketing strategy.
